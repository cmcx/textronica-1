Textronica 1 is a small project to rebuild a textgenerator that Theo Lutz and Rul Gunzenh√§user built in 1959 to produce their 'stochastic texts'. At the time, they only printed a couple of sentences and published even less than they produced. Textronica 1 should help to explore the logic and the esthetics of the generator and of the generated texts.
